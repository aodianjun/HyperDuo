 * read-only, but it is live: the framework pushes {@code put}/{@code delete}
 * bundles over Binder and re-fires the change listeners. A single listener is
 * registered once and every change simply re-reads the handful of values into
 * this object, then pokes the rendered hosts so the next frame uses the new
 * values. The listener is invoked on a Binder thread; {@code invalidateHosts}
 * always posts to the main looper, so that is safe.
 *

 * module working when the framework is embedded and cannot serve remote
