/**
 * Every decision about <em>what</em> the trio glyph puts on screen, resolved once
 * from a single settings snapshot.
 *
 * <p>Before this existed the same rule was written out by hand in five places:
 * {@code TrioRenderer.drawRingLayout}, {@code TrioRenderer.drawRectLayout},
 * {@code TrioHooks.applyMeterText}, the two battery-style hooks - and, in a
 * different shape again, the settings screen's own row gates. Copies drift, and
 * two of them had already drifted away from what the documentation claimed: the
 * rectangular arrangement silently ignored {@code valueCentred}, and the
 * percentage took the centre whenever Wi-Fi was absent whether or not the user
 * had asked for it.
 *
 * <p>This class is now the one place that rule lives. The renderer asks it what
 * to draw, the hook side asks it what to suppress, and the settings screen asks
 * it which rows mean anything - so a row can no longer be greyed out for a
 * reason the drawing code does not share.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately free of Android types and of static state. The hooked SystemUI
 * process and the settings app both build it, and the settings app builds it
 * again on every recomposition; it is a handful of field reads and copies, cheap
 * enough to build per frame.
 *
 * <p>Immutable.
