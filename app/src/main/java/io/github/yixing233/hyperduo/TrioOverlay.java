/**
 * Draws the trio glyph in a window of its own, so it is no longer bounded by the
 * status bar's own height.
 *
 * <p>The status bar is a real window with a real height: on this device it is
 * {@code ty=STATUS_BAR}, {@code (0,0)(fillx121)} - 121px, about 43dp, i.e.
 * {@code status_bar_height}. The glyph wants roughly 55dp drawn whole, and
 * everything past that rectangle is clipped by the window itself, not by the
 * view tree: enlarging the icon view's layout, handing it a taller
 * {@code LayoutParams}, or turning {@code clipChildren} off on the way up
 * cannot recover a single pixel of it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing about the status bar is changed here. A second window is added
 * instead, using {@code TYPE_STATUS_BAR_ADDITIONAL} - the type the platform
 * keeps for extra status bar surfaces - sized to the glyph, never touchable,
 * placed above the bar. The left half of the status bar - and anything else the
 * user has arranged there - shares neither layout nor window with it.
 *
 * <p>The window is pinned to the top of the screen: {@code y = 0} is the hard
 * edge, so the extra height can only grow downwards. Side by side with the bar,
 * the glyph therefore reads a few dp low - the cost of asking for more height
 * than the bar has, not a placement bug.
 *
 * <p>Every failure path hands the caller back to drawing in the host view: an
 * overlay that cannot be attached must never leave a glyph-shaped hole where
 * the battery icon used to be.
